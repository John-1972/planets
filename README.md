# Planets of the Solar System

This is the first and simplest MVC project shown on the After-Bootcamp site that newly-qualified bootcamp graduates can try to build for themselves. It's a slideshow app to display a photo of every planet that orbits the Sun, together with some basic statistics.

The instruction page can be seen here: http://after-bootcamp-website.herokuapp.com/projects/planets

And the end result can be seen here: https://planets-after-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/
